	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hi, I'm Steven Sawtelle! I'm currently working at Square as a software engineer on the Sales and Account Management Engineering team, where I make internal tools for Squares who do outbound connections. It's a pretty cool job and company! Before this, I was a software engineer at Bloomberg, with the Consumer Mobile team on the Bloomberg app for <a class="linked" rel="nofollow" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bloomberg-business-news/id281941097" alt="Google">iOS</a> and <a class="linked" rel="nofollow" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloomberg.android.plus&hl=en_US&gl=US" alt="Google">Android</a>. At Bloomberg I also worked with the Philanthropy Engineering team to develop tools that make engaging employees in philanthropic events easier as a Software Engineer. In the past, I've interned at <a class="linked" rel="nofollow" href="https://google.com/" alt="Google">Google</a>, <a class="linked" rel="nofollow" href="https://psware.com/" alt="Performance">Performance Software</a> and <a class="linked" rel="nofollow" href="https://viasat.com/" alt="ViaSat">ViaSat, Inc.</a> and spent an amazing semester in 2017 studying abroad at the <a class="linked" rel="nofollow" href="http://nus.edu.sg/" alt="NUS">National University of Singapore</a>, where I took classes in Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms, Game Design, Bollywood Studies, and Linguistics, and just generally fell in love with everything about Singapore. I'm a proud <a class="linked" rel="nofollow" href="http://asu.edu/" alt="ASU">Arizona State University</a> grad.</p>
	<p>I'm all about Software Engineering for good, so that's where I'm hoping to spend most of my career. If you want to talk about this with me, please feel free to reach out!</p>
	<p>A non-exhautive list of topics I can talk about until we're both exhausted: reading(<a href="/books" class="nav">check out what books I've read recently!</a>), writing(<a href="/blog" class="nav">check out my blog</a>), 3D printing, hiking, crossword and other puzzles, plotting, woodworking, game and escape room design, public policy, budget travel, and data visualization.</p>
	<p>Finally, this site is open source! Check it out <a class="linked" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/StevenSawtelle/stevensawtelle.github.io" alt="site_source">here</a>, and let me know if there's things I could do better - I'm new to this whole front end world.</p>
