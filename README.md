Repository for site (hosted on GitHub Pages) for Steven Sawtelle, found at www.stevensawtelle.com. I wanted a spot to serve as a hub for interested people and blog my thoughts, so here it is.

Pretty basic site primarily built on Jekyll and HTML with bits of CSS and JS thrown in, loosely using Bryan's [site](https://github.com/bryanpanesa/bryanpanesa.github.io) as a theme

Feel free to browse the code and use it as reference for any of your own projects, and if you have ideas I always appreciate forks!
