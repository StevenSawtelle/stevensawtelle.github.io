Repository for site (hosted on GitHub Pages) for Steven Sawtelle, found at www.stevensawtelle.com. I wanted a spot to serve as a hub for interested people and blog my thoughts, so here it is.

Build:

`sudo gem install jekyll bundler`
`bundle install`
`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Deploy:

Pushing to Github master branch should auto deploy the Github pages site
