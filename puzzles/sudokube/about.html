        <h1>Steven Sawtelle</h1>
        <p>
            Like sudoku puzzles, but dont't find them challenging enough? Enter my take on the classic: the Sudokube!
            <br>Sudokubes are made up of 6 smaller Sudoku puzzles each placed onto a face of a cube, and the edged/corners of
            matching faces have shared numbers. For example, if you have 1 in the bottom right corner of the puzzle on top face of the cube,
             that will mean there must also be a 1 in the top right corner of the front face (and even a 1 in the top left corner of the right face!)
            <br>I hope you enjoy playing around with my puzzle idea, and feel free to check it out on <a href="https://github.com/StevenSawtelle/sudokube">Github</a>
            if you are interested in learning more about how it's made! 
            <br>Currently supported options: zoom , pan, rotate, highlight, filling in empty squares (with keyboard)
            <br>Work in Progress features: filling in empty squares (without keyboard), answer verification, regenerating new puzzle freely
